# STMicroelectronics

These examples demonstrate how to use the Simulink Coder Support Package for STMicroelectronics Nucleo Boards to run a SimulinkÂ® model on an STMicroelectronics Nucleo board.

Simulink Coder Support Package for STMicroelectronics Nucleo Boards enables you to create and run Simulink models on supported STMicroelectronics Nucleo boards. The support package includes a library of Simulink blocks for configuring and accessing STMicroelectronics Nucleo peripherals and communication interfaces.

In this example you will learn how to configure a simple Simulink model to generate code for STMicroelectronics Nucleo F103RBT6 board and run the generated code on the board to periodically turn an LED on and off. You can configure this model for other supported Nucleo boards by browsing to 
#Configuration Parameters > #Hardware Implementation > #Hardware board and selecting the required board.
